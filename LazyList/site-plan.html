			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To provide people a space to save their ideas for what to do with freetime when they have none. Then, to remember those ideas when they find a spare bit of time.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Anyone who is old enough to know the value of freetime but young enough to not have much of it. This should be people from about 8-80 years old. Anyone can benefit from this site.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The home page will depend on a search bar, which iterates through an array of pre-loaded and user-added objects, then filters according to keywords. This will display the freetime activities most relevant to the user. The child page will utilize a form to input new activities for future querying.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

            <h3>Favicon</h3>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a

			<table class="colors">

					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Search (Home) page</h3>

            <p>Why is it always when we have no spare time that our greatest ideas for emerge? And why is it that when we finally find ourselves with nothing to do, we can rack our brains but those ideas are nowhere to be found? You're busy enough as it is to try and keep track of all the things you want to do when you find the time. Here, you can make note of all the things you'd like to do when that elusive free time rolls around, and then come back to find them all safely waiting for you. Have some lazy time right now? Search through our idea gallery to get an idea of what to do. 
                Too busy? Take a second to check out our input page and track one of your big ideas to come back for later.</p>
			<h3>Input Page</h3>
            <img src="images/beach-background.avif" alt="a orange and blue background that resembles a beach">
			<p>We know you're busy, so we'll keep this quick. Fill out as many of the fields as you need to remember your free time activity for later.</p>
            <p>(Form will include required text input fields for name and description. Other optional fields will include: duration, cost, indoor/outdoor, inspo link, etc.)</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				Once the user searches for an activity, the opening message and image will be replaced with the search results. They will be laid out individually for mobile and desktop view.
			</p>
			<img src="images/search_wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				The beach background will go behind the form. The list activity button will create an object for the activity they add and add it to a list they can query on the home page. There will be a message that displays to confirm the activity was added, and then they can add another one.
